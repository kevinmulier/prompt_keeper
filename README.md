    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file and fill out the required fields (see `.env.example` for reference).

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
    PORT = 3000
    ```

5. Run the project.
