# üìî Prompt Keeper

## üìù Description

Prompt Keeper is a web-based application designed to store and manage user prompts across various AI models such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude2, and Stable Diffusion. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete prompts. Users can also view their prompts in a dashboard and explore a public gallery of prompts from other users. With Google OAuth for authentication, Prompt Keeper offers a secure way to manage and keep track of all your prompts in one place.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file and fill out the required fields (see `.env.example` for reference).

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
    PORT = 3000
    ```

5. Run the project.

## üåü Insights Gained

The development process provided valuable insights into various technical areas critical for full-stack development.

### Software Architecture

- Utilizing the MVC architecture improved code organization and facilitated scalability.
- Implementing CRUD operations enhanced understanding of data flow in web applications.

### Authentication and Security

- Integrating Google OAuth clarified the fundamentals of OAuth protocols and token-based authentication.
- The adoption of Passport.js provided experience with middleware-based authentication in Node.js.

### Database Management

- Working with MongoDB and Mongoose offered practical experience in NoSQL database management.
- Schema design and data modeling were central to optimizing database interactions.

### Front-End Technologies

- The use of Handlebars.js provided exposure to server-side templating mechanisms.
